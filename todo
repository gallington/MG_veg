1. How to compare changes in clusters over time? (naiman repeat sampling)
2. find Meghan's new package -- ask Meghan for code
3. How to integrate my IMAR data in to the other dataset?
4. Can we get Jun Wang & Dan's veg data? Can we use Maria's veg data?


5. Environ params and gradients to consider:
  - CV in temp and precip across the region? that's at aggregate level tho, not per site. So that might come in on the axis?
  
6. Explanation of each variable from Ranjeet


From end of Rmd doc:
** TO DO **
* I still need to calculate richness stats to estimate turnover, compare between IMAR/MG
* We need to think about what other environmental variables we might be able to access and incorporate in to this.
* This is just a first stab with the CCA so Ia m going to work with these analyses some mrore as well.


7. Add FUNCTIONAL GROUP to each record. Have student add to table of Naiman data?

8. Add something about Treatment type to each record as well. 

9. Calculate turnover stats for IMAR and MG.
